# Redux Utils ðŸ”¨

My own redux toolkit.

Reducers and actions are somehwat closely tied, but some actions could be used in multiple reducers so the separation of making them is still good.

Selectors are completely separate things.


## makeReducer

Create a reducer and gives a function to add cases to the reducer.

## TODOs

Change any ValueType to be StateSlice
