## üìù Backlog

### üî• High Priority

- sorting on all list
- update images and games because they are very outdated
- (Bug üêû) Fix pricing for games that don't have a price and have bundles be the way to buy them.
- (Bug üêû) Check if correct games are appearing when finding games?

### üíß Medium Priority

- images and games in a job in the cloud
- make things accessible (tabbing over stuff, etc.)
- handle errors
- don't allow direct use of Link or force use of url constant. basically don't let me just put <Link to="/somewhere">, otherwise if i delete a page i'll have to manually find the locations.
- improve search functionality (e.g. make the text typed in smarter)
- form validation (e.g. name must be more than x characters)

### üßä Low priority

- mock test local environment
- remove lodash
- better loading screen
- improve images
- allow users to enter profile images
- make images lazy load? (don't load until on screen)
- tweak design a bit to be consistent? (e.g. the blue outline)
- make checkbox the original design
- fix centering of ListOfGamesPaginated results
