# TODO

## MVP
- finalized images
- load all users?
- add/delete friends
- ensure security rules are acceptable
- sort basically everything

## Bugs
- Fix pricing for games that don't have a price and have bundles be the way to buy them.

## Follow-up MVP
- make things accessible (tabbing over stuff, etc.)
- handle errors
- daily/weekly job to update games database
- wait for friends to load
- improve search functionality (e.g. make the text typed in smarter)
- create 404 page
- form validation (e.g. name must be more than x characters)

## Codebase Clean up
- organize components into proper folders (Common/Design)
- figure out how i want to organize firebase directory
- make firebase code better (e.g. better utility functions, don't cast)
- consistent naming for Profile or UserProfile
- lodash build stuff (i don't even see this in the build???????????)

- tsdoc (https://tsdoc.org/pages/intro/using_tsdoc/, https://api-extractor.com/pages/tsdoc/doc_comment_syntax/, https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc/tree/master/eslint-plugin)

## Enhancements
- loading spinner
- keep improving images
- make a /login and /logout page?

- make images lazy load? (don't load until on screen)
- tweak design a bit to be consistent? (e.g. the blue outline)
- make checkbox the original design
- fix centering of ListOfGamesPaginated results

# Application Idea

Codebase Flashcards
- It could be cool if I could create flashcards for my codebase to help me memorize functions or coding patterns?
