## Backlog

## MVP
- finalized images
- load all users?
- add/delete friends
- ensure security rules are acceptable
- sort basically everything
- test going directly to each url to make sure they all still work

## Bugs
- Fix pricing for games that don't have a price and have bundles be the way to buy them.
- Check if correct games are appearing when finding games?

## Follow-up MVP
- document a lot of stuff?
- mock test local environment
- jotai?
- make things accessible (tabbing over stuff, etc.)
- handle errors
- don't allow direct use of Link or force use of url constant. basically don't let me just put <Link to="/somewhere">, otherwise if i delete a page i'll have to manually find the locations.
- daily/weekly job to update games database
- wait for friends to load
- improve search functionality (e.g. make the text typed in smarter)
- create 404 page
- form validation (e.g. name must be more than x characters)

## Codebase Clean up
- organize components into proper folders (Common/Design)
- figure out how i want to organize firebase directory
- make firebase code better (e.g. better utility functions, don't cast)
- consistent naming for Profile or UserProfile
- lodash build stuff (i don't even see this in the build???????????)
