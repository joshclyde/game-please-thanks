## Ukulele Practice

Choose your practice configuration and goooooo.

Could turn this into it's own site if it turns out well.

## Reddit

Use api to show posts above a certain upvote count from subscribed subreddits.
Can mark a post as read.
This way I have a finite number of reddit posts to go through.

Could maybe do an infinite of the above with popular?

## Youtube

Same as reddit basically. Lemme know new videos from suscribers.

## Spotify

Maybe?

## Markdown Flashcards

Could do this if I wanted to. But there is already an app that seems pretty good for it.
(spaced repetition)

## Passwords

Could put my passwords in here?

## TODOs?

Simple, just give
- title/description
- date when it's due

## Notes?

Just writing down stuff.
